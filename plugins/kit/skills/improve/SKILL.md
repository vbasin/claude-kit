description: Develop and evaluate a reusable skill when work exposes a recurring capability gap. Use for capability discovery, targeted research, local candidates, and evidence-based promotion.
argument-hint: "<observed gap or failure>"

Improve the kit for: $ARGUMENTS

The user's task comes first: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/portable/kit-deliver/references/capabilities.md`
says when a capability is built during the task and when it waits for this cycle, which
runs only after the requested work is complete and verified, or when the user asks.

1. Record the observed task and concrete failure or missing capability. Search the repo's
   existing skills, tools, decision records and validated local candidates before building.
   If current facts matter, research primary documentation and retain source URLs and dates.
2. State what improvement is expected, when it applies, when it does not, and what could
   make it worse. Prefer a small existing capability over a duplicate. Remove secrets and
   unnecessary project data from reusable material.
3. If a reusable skill is justified, create a local candidate directory containing
   `candidate.json` with string fields `name`, `purpose`, `applies_when`, `not_for`, and
   `evidence`, plus `skill/SKILL.md` and any needed supporting files. Keep it out of the
   shared plugin until evaluated. For a generic skill that is host-neutral, add an empty
   `skill/.kit-portable` marker before evaluation. Avoid host-specific commands and tool
   assumptions in the transferable skill. Do not install or execute untrusted downloaded code.
4. For executable helpers, prepare or select a trusted independent suite outside the
   candidate. Each case supplies
   a small fixture and an argument-array check. The check receives `KIT_CANDIDATE_DIR`: it
   is empty for baseline and points to the skill for the candidate arm. Design a case that
   detects the desired improvement and at least one regression case that should remain
   successful. Include unseen tasks from more than one repository when practical.
5. Evaluate it the way `capabilities.md` step 4 says for what it is. Executable helpers:
   `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/learning.py" evaluate CANDIDATE --suite SUITE`
   runs each arm in a fresh copy, rejects regressions and requires an observed
   improvement; a shell suite executes with your permissions, so only use one you trust.
   Instructions only: an exit code cannot observe a `SKILL.md`, so a check that passes
   is a check that greps the file. Write a `plugins/kit/evals/` case and score it with
   and without the candidate (`claude plugin eval <dir> --case <name> --runs 2`); a
   positive Δ is the evidence, a zero Δ means the model already does it.
6. For a generic candidate with executable helpers, run `promote` with `--destination`
   pointing to an authorized working checkout's `plugins/kit/skills`; it reruns the suite
   and refuses to overwrite existing skills. An instructions-only candidate is promoted by
   copying it there together with the eval case that scored it. Either way, review the
   changes and prepare a draft PR when the task and available permissions authorize it.
   A marked, validated skill in `plugins/kit/skills` is discoverable by the portable
   installer for Codex and Grok as well as by the Claude plugin. Repo-specific knowledge
   stays in the relevant repo. Do not alter a suite just to pass.
7. Report the candidate, evidence, test commands, limitations, and proposed release/rollback.
   Use a bounded budget; stop and report a blocked outcome when checks cannot be run.
